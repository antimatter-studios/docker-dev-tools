{yel}Usage Example:{end} 
    ddt dns {yel}start restart set-ip=10.254.254.254{end}

{blu}Description:{end}
    This tool will start a docker container and listen on DNS Port 53 and handle
    requests for your local development networks. Whilst pushing upstream all
    other requests it can't resolve to an online DNS server

{blu}Options:{end}
    {cyn}Configuring IP Address and domains:{end}
        add-domain=yourdomain.com: Add a domain to the running DNS server
        remove-domain=yourdomain.com: Remove a domain to the running DNS server (see also --ip-address)
        set-ip=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx: Use this ip address when configuring the server instead of the default one

    {cyn}Toggling the DNS Server:{end}
        enable: Enable the DNS Server
        disable: Disable the DNS Server
        reset: Toggles the DNS Server as disabled then enabled as well as refreshing the dns cache
    
    {cyn}Running of the DNS Server Container:{end}
        start: Setup the DNS servers and start the DNS container
        restart: Restart the DNS Container
        stop: Stop the DNS container
        
    {cyn}Logging:{end}
        logs: View the logs from the DNS container
        logs-f: View and follow the logs from the DNS container
    
    {cyn}Configuration:{end}
        status: View a list of all the domains that are registered with the DNS server
        container-name[=xxx]: Get the name of this container to use, if passed a parameter it will update the settings with that value
        docker-image[=xxx]: Get the docker image name to use, if passed a parameter it will update the settings with that value
    
{blu}Notes:{end}
    {yel}Enabling, disable, and resetting{end} the DNS Server doesn't change the running status of the 
    DNS Container. It's just changing your system configuration from using the DNS Server or 
    going back to your default computer DNS settings. It's useful when you need to quickly toggle back 
    to the system defaults because the DNS Server might interfere with running a VPN. So you can quickly 
    disable it, do your other work. Then re-enable it when you need to get back to working with the 
    development environment. It's like a soft reset of your DNS configuration so you can temporarily 
    do something.
    
    {yel}Starting, Stopping, and Restarting{end} implies also {yel}enabling and disabling{end} the 
    DNS Server like explained above. However it does the extra step of Starting or Stopping the 
    docker container as well. So it's more like a hard reset.
