{yel}Usage Example:{end} dns ip {yel}set=10.254.254.254 get remove add reset{end}

{blu}Description:{end}
    This tool creates an alias for {yel}localhost{end}/{yel}127.0.0.1{end} on your machine which is 
    addressable from your local machine and from inside docker containers. This is useful when wanting 
    to connect xdebug from your software running inside a container, to your local machine where your 
    IDE Is listening for incoming connections
    
{blu}Options:{end}
    set=xxx: Add an IP Address to your configuration stack, this value will be remembered and used in the future
    get: Get the Currently configured IP Address.
    add: Add {yel}$alias{end} as an ip alias for {yel}127.0.0.1{end}
    remove: Remove {yel}$alias{end} from your computer
    reset: Remove and Add the configuration again, just in case it broke somehow
    ping: Ping the configured ip address
    
{blu}Notes:{end}
    Please don't use {yel}localhost{end} or {yel}127.0.0.1{end}
    
    The problem is that inside a docker container, {yel}localhost{end} resolves to itself 
    and {yel}127.0.0.1{end} also. This means you have no ip address which is addressable 
    from your local machine, or inside docker containers.
